Blood Bank System using html

The process of managing the blood bag that is received from the blood donation events needs a proper and systematic management.
The blood bag must be handled with care and treated thoroughly as it is related to someoneâ€™s life.
The development of Web-based Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is proposed to provide a management functional to the blood bank in order to handle the blood bag. 
In Kuala Terengganu, East Peninsular Coast of Malaysia has only one government hospital that handles blood bank currently is using a standalone system.
This web-based management system was developed to meet the requirements for Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital (HSNZ). 
Other hospital may have different ways and approach of handling blood bag.
